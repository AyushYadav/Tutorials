# Tutorials
Jane's simple tutorials for using python to do astronomical data reduction and visualization.  
I've recently started using pyds9, and I've been experimenting with pyregion.
pyds9 didn't have a tutorial, so I wrote one.
pyregion did have a tutorial, but it used matplotlib's imshow, which I hate.  So I wrote a quick, 
not-yet-finished example of using pyds9 and pyregion together (clunkily).  
Improvements welcome!
